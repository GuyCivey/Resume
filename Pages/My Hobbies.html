		<h3>My Story</h3>
		<p>
			I began my web development journey in 2020 during the pandemic, when I
			found myself out of work and eager to learn new skills. I started by
			teaching myself HTML, which quickly evolved into learning CSS and
			JavaScript. As my knowledge grew, I pursued formal lessons to further
			deepen my understanding of web development. Although I was able to pick up
			the material quickly, my time to practice became limited once I returned
			to work.
		</p>
		<p>
			As my family grew, I saw new opportunities in applying my skills to smart
			home technologies. This shift in focus allowed me to use my coding
			knowledge in a practical setting, further developing my skillset. However,
			over time, my focus shifted away from general coding and programming and
			into proprietary systems that were limited to specific applications.
			Realizing I wanted to return to my passion for coding, I began searching
			for a career path that would allow me to fully dedicate myself to web
			development and continue growing as a developer.
